# Birdclef-2024-audio-classification
This repository contains code and resources for the BirdCLEF 2024 competition on Kaggle. The project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify bird species from audio recordings. The implementation involves feature extraction using mel-spectrograms, model training, and prediction on test audio files.
